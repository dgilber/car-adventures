# Car Adventures
Car Adventures is a game I wrote with my kids.  It's a family exercise, to teach my kids
how to become more intimate with computers.

This project should have little value to outsiders.

## How to Play
Clone the project, then launch `game.html` through a browser.

### Goal
Drive the car, try to run-over as many dinosaurs as you can to keep your fuel tank from
running empty.
